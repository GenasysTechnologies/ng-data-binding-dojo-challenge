# DojoChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to provide a starting point for learning and playing around
with data binding and shared data in Angular. There are three parts to this challenge:

- Part A - `./src/app/part-a` - Is focused on learning data binding for one component
- Part B - `./src/app/part-b` - Is focused on data binding, input and output between multiple components
- Part C - `./src/app/part-c` - Is focused on data shared between multiple components with navigation

## Requirements

The requirement for all three parts is the same:

- Make the buttons adjust the counter displayed.
- The `+` button should increment the couner.
- The `-` button should decrement the counter.

## Rules

- Do not change the current "nested-ness" (DOM structure) of the component given.
- You are free to add any additional services, directives, classes, etc.
- You should not need to add additional components.

## Development server

To start, run `npm install` to get all the required node modules for the project.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`
directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
